# (Group Project) Mulitiple Listing System Documentation
* This is a web application simulating a property listing system with CRUD operations. A good business example is https://www.realtor.ca/. 
* There are totally 16 entities in the domain directory(server folder). The backend server("server_property") provides RESTful APIs to the frontend("front_client"). 
* Attention: only backend ("server_property" folder) is currently finished.

# Quick Start
* Reload pom.xml with maven, and run ServerPropertyApplication.java under "server_property/src/main/java/mls/server_property/" directory. 
* Assigned port is localhost:8090. There is an example database file exampleData.sql under "/server_property/docs/" directory. You can import it in MySQL workbench as an example.

# APIs
The backend controller provides following APIs:
1. Get method (read): 
    1. **/api/property**  -> return all properties' JSON data in the database
    2. **/api/property/{Long id}** -> return the specified id property's JSON data in the database
    3. **/api/property/ids** -> return the specified ids properties' JSON data in the database
    4. **/api/property/type** -> return sepcified type properties' JSON data in the database. There are 16 types in total, corresponding to 16 entity classes under domain directory. The domain hierarchy is as follows: ![hierarchy](/server_property/docs/domain.jpg)
2. Put method (update): **api/property/{id}** -> update the specified id property's records
3. Post method (create): **api/property/post-record** -> create and add new property to the database
4. Delete method (delete): **api/property/{id}** -> remove the specified id property from the database
